# Predicting-Salary-Probability
<p>Creating a model to predict the probability that someone's salary is above 5 million, where the description of the output is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>0: Salary &lt;= 5 million</li>
  <li>1: Salary &gt; 5 million</li>
</ul>

The model is trained and evaluated based on the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) metric
